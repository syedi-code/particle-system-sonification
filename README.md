# Particle System Sonification
## Usage
- Open particle_system_sonification.maxpat in Max/MSP
- Click within the white box (p5 canvas) to generate new particles
- A generated particle will be at rest - adjust system heat using the labeled slider in "SKETCH CONTROLS" to change the net velocity of all particles
- The simulation can be reset using the "CLEAR CANVAS" bang in sketch controls

## Setup
Download or clone this repository and run the Max/MSP patch. A working installation of Max 8 is required.
